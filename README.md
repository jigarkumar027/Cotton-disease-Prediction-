# Cotton-disease-Prediction-

Cotton Disease Prediction is a Project Where The Quality of the plant are being Predicted using the Deep Learning.

Here I Used the concept called Transfer Leaning To Predict The Plant.
There are So many Model Availabel at Keras Application Form To Used For Prediction.
Here i have used Resnet50 Model For Prediction.

The Link for the Keras Page : https://keras.io/api/applications/

The Resnet50 Is having This Many Pre-trained Perameter : 25,636,712

Some screenshots of Prediction :

The Above One is a Correctly Predicted image.

Now The Wrong Predicted Image:

The Credict For The Frontend : Krish Naik Sir And AI Production.

Here We can Train This Model On Another Model Like ResNet152V2, InceptionV3 And Many more...
We Can Also Build It with CNN (  i have Tried this but Could not able to get the Proper Result ).

So The technologies Are Groving Everywhere And Could be Used at any place To make It more reliable and For Convenience of human.
And Agreculture plays a Very Important Role in Human Life.
