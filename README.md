# Cotton-disease-Prediction-

Cotton Disease Prediction is a Project Where The Quality of the plant are being Predicted using the Deep Learning.

Here I Used the concept called Transfer Leaning To Predict The Plant.
There are So many Model Availabel at Keras Application Form To Used For Prediction.
Here i have used Resnet50 Model For Prediction.

The Link for the Keras Page : https://keras.io/api/applications/

The Resnet50 Is having This Many Pre-trained Perameter : 25,636,712

Some screnshots of Prediction :
